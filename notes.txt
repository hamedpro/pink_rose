also take care about todos and notes of corp_webapp repository
consider that you may save value of new Date().getTime() and in the future users's region change and date calculations go wrong so do something to cover all possible cases of utc and local changes related issues
use utc timestamps everywhere saving or processing a date and just use local date in showing step and say it exactly
take care about this in future cases : that if route change for ex from /users/:34234 to /users/:44444 the rendered component will not re render and this is handled by passing a timestamp as prop to the route element
add env.json to gitignore when it starts to have personal important env vars
currently there is an active account registered in my machine : username : 'hamedpro', password : "hamed"

-------
todo : solve this problem : 
currently when user is not logged in but opens
/dashboard when it wants to load data to show in primary side bar it gets user_id from
localStorage but it returns null and when getting for example users it's filter
will look like this : {user_id : null } and when it passes it to JSON.stringify
before sending it to server all fields with value == null disapper and it leads
it to load all_users or all data ... 
-------

todo just update keys of Route s when there is a change in url (it will avoid extra re-renders)
